# Hurricane Intensities and Climate Change: An Analysis of a Criticism

## Summary of the Criticism 

An interesting article was uploaded online by an individual named Paul Homewood called _“Increasing Hurricane Intensity Study Fatally Flawed”_. The main argument of Paul Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) is that climate change is not causing an increase in Hurricane intensity and is instead simply a result of the natural ocean cycles called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations (AMOs). In an attempt to prove his claim, the author presents a study done by Kossin et. al [(2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975), in which a 39-year record from 1979-2017 was analyzed to determine trends in tropical cyclone intensities. Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) also cites and quotes a blog post written by Briggs [(2021)](https://wmbriggs.com/post/34364/) which criticized the statistics used in the paper by Kossin et al [(2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975). This was used to attempt to disprove the idea of climate change impacting hurricane intensity, show that climate science is fundamentally flawed, and propose that the issue is simply a result of the above-mentioned natural AMOs. 

There are multiple sources of information that have differing opinions here, and this issue must be reconciled in order to determine whether Paul Homwood is correct, or mistaken. First and foremost, it is important to determine whether the study by Kossin et. al [(2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975) is truly flawed, as claimed by Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) and Briggs [(2021)](https://wmbriggs.com/post/34364/).  

Briggs [(2021)](https://wmbriggs.com/post/34364/) claims that there were errors in the statistical analysis of the dataset in the study by Kossin et. al [(2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975). This is true, as the paper had to be edited and the errors are addressed on the original _PNAS_ source. The paper originally claimed that the proportion of global major hurricane winds was increased by 15% over the interval studied, when in fact, the increase was only 10%. Briggs [(2021)](https://wmbriggs.com/post/34364/) explains that this value is no longer statistically significant. 
Hence, the above analysis fuels the claim of Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) that climate change is not causing an increase in Hurricane intensity, and that climate science is fundamentally flawed. He states that due to the fact that there is no significant increase, and only the Atlantic Basin shows change, this must be a result of natural AMOs. 

__However, this argument is an exaggeration with little evidence to support it__.

## Evaluation of the Facts
The first problem with the claim made by Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) is that he does not use any peer reviewed sources to support that climate change is out of the question. The blog post written by Briggs [(2021)](https://wmbriggs.com/post/34364/) that Paul Homewood uses as the “scientific” basis for his claim has not been peer reviewed and thus has not been critiqued, which makes it a poor choice for Homewood to have used in the first place. Briggs [(2021)](https://wmbriggs.com/post/34364/) exaggerates the mistakes he points out in his blog post, which were minor corrections that Kossin et al. [(2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975) fixed. It did not impact the overall conclusion that hurricane intensity is increasing due to climate change. 

Peer-review aside, Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) weakens his own claim further by oversimplifying the issue at hand. He narrows his view by only looking at how the statistics of Kossin et al. [(2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975) were initially incorrect, and then pushes his claim that hurricane intensity is only increasing due to AMO’s, citing only a simple definition of AMO’s from the NOAA. He overestimates the stability of AMO’s and their predictability. 

Many reputable sources including the NOAA do explain that natural AMOs are a major factor that can result in more intense hurricanes [(NOAA, 2007)](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/faq/amo_faq.php), which is in line with Paul Homewood’s claims. However, Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) does not take into account the fact that climate change, specifically the anthropogenic contributions to climate change, could have impacts on the AMOs themselves, resulting in more complications. Aerosols and greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere can favour the persistence of multidecadal oscillations [(Bellomo et. al, 2016)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL069961). The strength of this feedback has often been underestimated [(Bellomo et. al, 2016)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL069961), and can alter the magnitude and period of AMOs, making this issue less trivial and predictable than Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) makes it out to be. This goes to show that looking at science from a narrow point of view can be detrimental. Hence, it can be concluded that climate change and anthropogenic impacts on the atmosphere can alter hurricane intensity, and the issue cannot  simply be attributed to “natural AMO cycles” as Homewood [(2021)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/) claims.
